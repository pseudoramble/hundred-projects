**Bulk Picture Manipulator** – This program will take in a directory of pictures and apply a certain effect to them whether it be reducing color count, changing its format, or alter file attributes. For something extra try to see if you can also create a system to tag them.

**YouTube Downloader** – A program which can download videos to your hard drive from youtube.com. Save the files in various formats including FLV and AVI.
