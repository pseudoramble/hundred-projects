##Web

**Web Browser with Tabs** – Create a small web browser that allows you to navigate the web and contains tabs which can be used to navigate to multiple web pages at once. For simplicity don’t worry about executing Javascript or other client side code.

**Page Scraper** – Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. For added complexity, organize the indexed content and don’t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.

**File Downloader** – An application which can download various objects on a page including video streams or all files on a page. Great for pages with a lot of download links.


**Bandwidth Monitor** – A small utility program that tracks how much data you have uploaded and downloaded from the net during the course of your current online session. See if you can find out what periods of the day you use more and less and generate a report or graph that shows it.

**Password Safe** – A program which keeps track of passwords for sites or applications and encrypts them with a key so that no one can read them.


**Scheduled Auto Login and Action** – Make an application which logs into a given site on a schedule and invokes a certain action and then logs out. This can be useful for checking web mail, posting regular content, or getting info for other applications and saving it to your computer.


**Content Management System** – Create a content management system (CMS) like Joomla, Drupal, PHP Nuke etc. Start small and allow for the addition of modules/addons later.
